# Demos for AWS workloads

This repository will provide some demo examples from my daily AWS workloads. It will probably grow day by day. So far, the most examples are written in Python. Therefore, feel free to participate!

## Big Data workloads

* Lambda does not fit? The [SQS example](SQS/README.MD) will show you how to unzip large gzip files via S3 events and EC2.

## Hosting Docker on AWS

* Do you want to host a Docker container as Apache webserver? The [Docker example](Docker/README.MD) will show you how.

## Deploying an AWS Lambda on AWS via Serverless

* You do not how a deployment to AWS Lambda could work? The example on [Serverless](https://github.com/Zirkonium88/AWS/tree/master/Lambda/ServerlessDemo/README.MD) will show how.
* Do you need a example for simple Lambda processing pipeline? In the tutorial for connecting [Amazon S3 and DynamoDB via AWS Lambda](https://github.com/Zirkonium88/AWS/tree/master/Lambda/GetImagenames/README.MD), you will get your example.
