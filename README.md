# Demos for AWS workloads

This repository will provide some demo examples from my daily AWS workloads. It will probably grow day by day. So far, the most examples are written in Python. Therefore, feel free to participate!

## Big Data workloads

* Lambda does not fit? The [SQS example](SQS/README.MD) will show you how to unzip large gzip files via S3 events and EC2.

## Hosting Docker on AWS

* Do you want to host a Docker container as Apache webserver? The [Docker example](Docker/README.MD) will show you how.
