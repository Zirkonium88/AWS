# PAGER=/usr/local/bin/less

# ## Example .Renviron on Windows
# R_LIBS=C:/R/library
# MY_TCLTK="c:/Program Files/Tcl/bin"

# ## Example of setting R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES (from R CMD check)
# R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES='utils,grDevices,graphics,stats'
# # this loads the packages in the order given, so they appear on
# # the search path in reverse order.

## # We comment out this line in the default Renviron, you can re-enable it here
## # @R_PLATFORM@ can be eg x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, see /etc/R/Renviron for R_PLATFORM
## # @MAJ_MIN_VERSION@ is likely something like '3.4', see /etc/R/Renviron too
## #
## # Also note that you set this per-user via '%p' and '%v' for platform and version
#R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/R/@R_PLATFORM@-library/@MAJ_MIN_VERSION@'}

## Debian (and its derivatives) impose a set of compiler flags to prevent some known
## security issues with compiled code.  These flags then become defaults for R as well
## (see eg /etc/R/Makeconf) but nevertheless confuse R as warnings get triggers.  Users,
## on the other hand, are often stumped about these.  So with this variable we declare
## these options as known for the local checks on the machine this file is on.
##
## See Section 8 of the R Internals manual for many more options to customize tests.
